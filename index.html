          <p>This is a proof of concept Regular Expression engine that handles sub-match grouping and back-references without backtracking. See <a href = "UserGuide.html">here</a> for a User Guide and <a href="Algorithm.html">here</a> for a short explanation of how it achieves this.</p>

<p><em><strong>What it does</strong></em></p>

<p>This is a full-fledged regular expression engine written in Java. It is unique in that it is a one-pass NFA engine <em>without</em> backtracking that can handle back-references, provide sub-match groupings and process lookaround operators with arbitrary embedded regular expressions(including variable-length operators like + and *). The ability to handle back-references without backtracking or multiple passes is unique among publicly available regular expression engines - including popular ones like PERL, PCRE or java.util.regex.</p>

<p><em><strong>What it includes</strong></em></p>

<p>It handles most constructs supported by the java.util.regex engine except for those outlined <a href = "#not_included">here</a>. </p>

<p> Additional features</p>
<ul>
<li> Backreferences are processed without backtracking or multiple passes. This offers a significant performance advantage.
<p></p>
<li> Lookbehind operator can handle arbitrary regular expressions including + and * operators.
</ul>

<a name = "not_included"></a>
<p><em><strong>What's not included</strong></em></p>

<p>Atomic grouping and possessive quantifiers are not supported but are not necessary since they are primarily a way to work around issues created by backtracking. </p>

<p>Non-capturing groups are not supported since they do not provide a significant performance advantage with this engine's method of operation.</p>

<p>The boundary matcher \G is not needed with this engine's method of operation and is not supported. </p>

<p>Lazy quantifiers and named capturing groups are not supported.</p>

<p>Character representation with octal and hexadecimal numbers are not yet supported.</p>

<p>UNICODE characters and character classes are not yet supported.</p>

<p>Quotations - \Q and \E are not yet supported.</p>

<p>Java.util.regex supports various flags - only case-sensitive, comment and the newline related flags are relevant in the absence of UNICODE support but are not yet supported by this engine. The default mode is CASE_INSENSITIVE off, UNIX_LINES and DOTALL modes on</p>
