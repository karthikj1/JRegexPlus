This is a proof of concept Regular Expression engine that handles submatch grouping and backreferences without backtracking.

It handles most of the constructs handled by the java.util.regex engine except for reluctant quantifiers, named groups and UNICODE characters. 

See http://karthikj1.github.io/JRegexPlus/ for more details.

Atomic grouping and possessive quantifiers are not supported but are not necessary since they are primarily a way to work around issues created by backtracking. Non-capturing groups are not supported since they do not provide a significant performance advantage with this engine's method of operation.

UNICODE characters are not yet supported.

Various flags supported by Java are not yet supported by this engine - only case-sensitive, comment and the newline related flags are relevant in the absence of UNICODE support. The default flag settings are CASE_INSENSITIVE off, UNIX_LINES and DOTALL on.
